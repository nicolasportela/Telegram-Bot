## 1. Installation and Usage <a name="1"></a>

### i. Devs <a name="11"></a>
In order to run and use the bot from the point of view of devs, it is so simple as:

**First**. Clone this repository in a Linux environment: https://github.com/nicolasportela/Telegram-Bot.git. \
**Second**. Install the python-telegram-bot library: `pip install python-telegram-bot`\
**Third**. Run its main file (bot\.py) from the command line as any Python or executable file: `python3 bot.py` or `./bot.py`, respectively (to stop it, run Ctrl+C).\
**Fourth**. Open a chat with [SuperHolbie](http://t.me/SuperHolbieBot) in Telegram and start to use it pressing "start" button.

\
**Before starting, you must consider:** 
* You need to be a Holberton School student in order to get some keys required to retrieve information from its API, represented in the source code by environment variables: HBTNAPIKEY (Holberton API key), HBTNEMAIL (Holberton account e-mail), HBTNPASSWORD (Holberton account password).
* You need to ask for your own Telegram bot token: [here instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot). It is represented in the source code by the environment variable named TGTOKEN.
* "Procfile" and "requirements.txt" are files required by Heroku to deployment. You won't need them if you won't deploy your bot or if you will do it using other services.

### iii. Usage <a name="13"></a>
A Telegram bot consists on an automatized software ready to respond according to commands, messages and requests entered by users or other automatized processes. In this sense, SuperHolbie is able to respond to the following commands at the moment:

* `/start`: Shows a welcome message and describes available commands
* `/project`: Receives a Holberton School project's ID (integer number) as input from user and retrieves information about that project: name, tasks, GitHub directory and GitHub repository. It alerts if the ID entered is not valid and asks for a new one.
